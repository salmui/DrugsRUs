INSERT INTO `interactions` VALUES (1,'Impact: Possible epileptogenic activity; possible theophylline toxicity; inhibition of hepatic metabolism of theophylline by quinolones.\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to the GABA receptor, resulting in general excitation of the central nervous system.\n\nPrevention: Obtain theophylline level prior to initiation of a quinolone. Of the quinolones, exoxacin and ciproflaxin reduce theophylline clearance by 30-84%. Consider switching to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or trovafloxacin; these agents appear not to inhibit theophylline metabolism.Drug interactions are often clinically unrecognized and responsible for increased morbidity in elderly patients. Prudent use of medications and vigilant drug monitoring are essential to avoid drug–drug interactions.\n\nManagement: Attention should be paid to the possible epileptogenic activity of the simultaneous administration of quinolones with theophylline.'),(2,'Impact: Potential for digoxin toxicity.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Multiple theories exist, but actual mechanism is unknown. Amiodarone may decrease the clearance of digoxin, resulting in prolonged digoxin activity. There may also be an additive effect on the sinus node of the heart.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Obtain digoxin level prior to initiation of amiodarone therapy. Then, decrease dose of digoxin by 25-50% and monitor digoxin levels once weekly for several weeks.8,9 Digoxin therapy should be cautiously started in with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypothyroidism due to the potential for adverse drug reactions at lower digoxin levels.10,11\n\nMonitoring/Precautions:\n\nMaintain digoxin level below 2ng/mL (2.6nmol/L).12\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity (abdominal pain, anorexia, bizarre mental symptoms in the elderly, blurred vision, bradycardia, confusion, delirium, depression, diarrhea, disorientation, drowsiness, fatigue, hallucinations, halos around lights, visual acuity, mydriasis nausea, neuralgia, nightmares, personality changes, photophobia, restlessness, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness).\nMonitor heart rate for bradycardia and EKG-look for elongated PR interval.\nMonitor calcium, magnesium and potassium levels.'),(3,'Impact: Potential for digoxin toxicity.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Serum digoxin concentration rise by 60-75% due to decreased renal tubular secretion and nonrenal clearance mechanisms.12,13 Biliary clearance of digoxin is reduced by 42-43% when administered with verapamil.14,15 Additionally, there appears to be a synergistic effect of slowing impulse conduction and muscle contractility, leading to bradycardia and possible heart block.8,16\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Monitor heart rate and EKG-PR interval. Evaluate selection of verapamil and digoxin. If patient has CHF, note that verapamil has not proven any benefit in mortality or morbidity; furthermore, digoxin offers no additional benefit in mortality, but does improve symptomatology. Digoxin therapy should be cautiously started in patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypothyroidism due to the potential for adverse drug reactions at lower digoxin levels.10,11\n\nMonitoring/Precautions:\n\nMaintain digoxin level below 2ng/mL (2.6nmol/L).12\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity (abdominal pain, anorexia, bizarre mental symptoms in the elderly, blurred vision, bradycardia, confusion, delirium, depression, diarrhea, disorientation, drowsiness, fatigue, hallucinations, halos around lights, visual acuity, mydriasis nausea, neuralgia, nightmares, personality changes, photophobia, restlessness, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness).\nMonitor heart rate for bradycardia and EKG-PR interval.\nMonitor calcium, magnesium and potassium levels.'),(4,'Impact: Potential for elevated serum potassium levels.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Inhibition of ACE results in decreased aldosterone production and potentially decreased potassium excretion.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Draw potassium level prior to initiation of ACE-inhibitor in a patient.\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: Potassium levels greater than 5.0 mmol/L should be monitored carefully due to risk of severe hyperkalemia and EKG changes. Watch renal function (BUN, SCr) also. Adjust potassium supplementation if levels increase.'),(5,'Impact: Potential for elevated serum potassium levels.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Unknown.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Evaluate need for additional drug therapy. ACE inhibitors are recommended in diabetic patients for nephroprotection. Spironolactone increased survival in patients with severe CHF. Prior to initiation, obtain a potassium level with a serum creatinine and BUN to further evaluate use of these agents in combination.7\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: Potassium levels greater than 5.0 mmol/L and serum creatinine concentrations greater than 2.5mg/dL should be monitored carefully due to risk of severe hyperkalemia and EKG changes.7'),(6,'Impact: Potential for increased effects of warfarin and/or phenytoin.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Currently unknown, but one theory suggests a genetic basis involving liver metabolism of warfarin and phenytoin. Phenytoin may increase the effects of warfarin.6\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Obtain baseline phenytoin levels prior to initiation of warfarin. Monitor INR during co-administration. Target INR should be towards the lower end of the therapeutic goal range.\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: INR and phenytoin levels should be monitored during co-administration. Signs and symptoms of an active bleed should be monitored daily with particular attention to the appearance and patterns of bruises. Signs of an active bleed include: coughing up blood in the form of coffee grinds (hemoptysis), gingival bleeding, nose bleeds, cola- or tea-colored urine (hematuria), and black, tarry stools (hemoccult positive?).'),(7,'Impact: Potential for increased effects of warfarin.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Currently, the interaction with sulfa drugs is unknown; however, clinicians hypothesize that warfarin`s activity is prolonged due a decreased production of vitamin K by intestinal flora affected by systemic antibiotic administration. Additionally, a hypoprothrombinemic effect may occur when S-warfarin is combined with sulfaethoxazole/trimethoprim.3\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Avoid concomitant use of a sulfa drug with warfarin, particularly sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Identify microbial pathogen prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Consider culture sensitivity screening as research indicates cautious use of any antibiotic with warfarin. If use of a sulfa drug is imperative, then reduce warfarin dose by 50% during antibiotic administration and for one week following completion of the antibiotic. If sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy is required, then monitor INR every other day for elevating trends.2\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: INR should be monitored during co-administration of warfarin with a sulfa drug other than sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and warfarin dose adjustments made as necessary.1 Signs and symptoms of an active bleed should be monitored daily with particular attention to the appearance and patterns of bruises. Signs of an active bleed include: coughing up blood in the form of coffee grinds (hemoptysis), gingival bleeding, nose bleeds, cola- or tea-colored urine (hematuria), and black, tarry stools (hemoccult positive?).'),(8,'Impact: Potential for increased effects of warfarin.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: Erythromycin inhibits the metabolism and subsequent clearance of warfarin from the body. The activity of warfarin may also be prolonged due to alterations in the intestinal flora and its production of vitamin K for clotting factor production.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: The interaction between warfarin and macrolide antibiotics is highly probable and often delayed. Concomitant use of a macrolide with warfarin should be avoided; switch to an alternative antibiotic. Microbial pathogen identification prior to antibiotic initiation will decrease the prevalence of unnecessary drug interaction risk. Consider culture sensitivity screening as research indicates cautious use of any antibiotic with warfarin.\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: If use of a macrolide is imperative, then monitor INR every other day and adjust warfarin dosing as necessary.2 Signs and symptoms of an active bleed should be monitored daily with particular attention to the appearance and patterns of bruises. Signs of an active bleed include: coughing up blood in the form of coffee grinds (hemoptysis), gingival bleeding, nose bleeds, cola- or tea-colored urine (hematuria), and black, tarry stools (hemoccult positive?).'),(9,'Impact: Potential for increased effects of warfarin.1\n\nMechanism of Interaction: The exact warfarin-quinolone drug interaction is unknown. Reduction of intestinal flora responsible for vitamin K production by antibiotics is probable as well as decreased metabolism and clearance of warfarin.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Culture and identify microbial pathogen prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Consider culture sensitivity screening. The metabolism of warfarin may be delayed in patients administered enoxacin,4 ciprofloxacin,4,5 norfloxacin,4 or ofloxacin4; thus, quinolone selection should focus on one of the newer agents that has not demonstrated significant impairment of warfarin metabolism, such as levofloxacin. Additionally, microbial pathogen identification and sensitivity prior to antibiotic initiation will decrease the prevalence of unnecessary drug interaction risk.\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: INR should be monitored during co-administration of warfarin with a quinolone. If use of ciprofloxacin is imperative, then monitor INR every other day and adjust warfarin dose as necessary.2 Signs and symptoms of an active bleed should be monitored daily with particular attention to the appearance and patterns of bruises. Signs of an active bleed include: coughing up blood in the form of coffee grinds (hemoptysis), gingival bleeding, nose bleeds, cola- or tea-colored urine (hematuria), and black, tarry stools (hemoccult positive?).'),(10,'Impact: Potential for serious bleed1 (GI, hemorrhage).\n\nMechanism of Interaction: NSAIDs increase gastric irritation and erosion of the protective lining of the stomach, assisting in the formation of a GI bleed. Additionally, NSAIDs decrease the cohesive properties of platelets necessary in clot formation.\n\nAlternatives to Patient Management: Avoid concomitant use of an NSAID with warfarin.2 Identify reason for NSAID therapy. If anti-pyretic effects are desired, then consider acetaminophen. Acetaminophen in doses less than 2g/day on a short-term basis do not appear to affect the INR.2 Long-term use of acetaminophen for anti-pyretic and analgesic effects is controversial. If anti-inflammatory effects are necessary, then consider cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor therapy. The reduction of prevalence of gastric adverse advents with these agents combined with the lack of anti-platelet action, support the cautious use of COX-2 inhibitors in anticoagulation patients.2There are some case reports discussing the elevation of INRs with COX-2 inhibitors. If analgesic effects are desired, caution should also be exhibited with the use of tramadol; there are a few case reports describing an elevation of the INR with concomitant administration of tramadol with warfarin.\n\nMonitoring/Precautions: INR should be monitored every week with co-administration of warfarin with an NSAID. Signs and symptoms of an active bleed should be monitored with particular attention to the appearance and patterns of bruises. Signs of an active bleed include: coughing up blood in the form of coffee grinds (hemoptysis), gingival bleeding, nose bleeds, cola- or tea-colored urine (hematuria), or black, tarry stools (hemoccult positive?).');
